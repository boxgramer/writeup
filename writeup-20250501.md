# Note(Datetime, Name) : 

### Metodelogy
 1. Investigate the system to retrieve a list of features
 2. Discribe the feature and explain how it works
 3. List possible vulnerabilities and group by feature
 4. Proof of concept for possible vulnerabilities
 5. What is the impact of the vulnerabilities after the proof of concept ?

## feature:      
1. GET / -> home
### steps taken:
1. access /test -> got response `Not Found :/test`
2. access /<script> -> `Not Found: /%3Cscript%3E` thats mean url is encode
3. access /../post -> cache miss  and got response `Not Found: /../post`
4. access /< -> `Not Found /%3C` 
5. access /%2e%2e/post -> `Not Found /%2e%2e/post` 
6. try fuzz with payload -> that confirm the page stored in cache sever is store encoded  the server respone not doing anyting with original url to store in cache
    - ../post -> cache miss and got response `Not Found: /../post`
    - %2e%2e/post -> cache hit and got response `Not Found: /../post`
